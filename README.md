# CutScript

This is a simple script I threw together to help with moving files between directories I'm woking in while programming.

# Usage

To use this script make sure its in a location that your PATH has access to.
The way to use this script is by either providing a file or folder in your working directory.

cs <file_input>

Then moving to a terminal in your working directory.

cs

# Implementation

This script uses a cache that is stored at ~/.cscache. 

Another way you could implement this would be moving the file or folder to a caching location.

# Future

The likelyhood of me ever working on this script in the future is close to zero but I would like to add some commands that signify copying vs. moving and having multiple pasting buffers throughout multiple terminals.
